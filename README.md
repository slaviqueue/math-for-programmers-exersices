# Math for programmers

Here I solve exercises from the [Math for programmers](https://www.manning.com/books/math-for-programmers) book.

I use Jupyter Notebook and Python.

## How to set up

- Run `source env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
- Use `pip install` to install dependencies
