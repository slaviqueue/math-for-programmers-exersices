# Exercise 4.8

Without running it, what is the result of applying the
transformation compose(rotate_z_by(pi/2),rotate_x_by(pi/2))? What if you
switch the order of the composition?

As a result, the model will be rotated by 90deg by y axis. If reverse
the transformation, the model will be rotated by -90deg.
