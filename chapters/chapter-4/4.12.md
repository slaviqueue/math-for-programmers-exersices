# Exercise 4.12

The identity transformation is the vector transformation that
returns the same vector it is passed. It is denoted with a capital I, so we
could write its definition as I(v) = v for all vectors v. Explain why I is a
linear transformation.

## Answer:

I is a linear transformation, because it preserves addition and scaling, so:

```
I((1, 1, 1) + (2, 2, 2)) = I(1, 1, 1) + I(2, 2, 2)
I((1, 1, 1) * 2) = (I(1, 1, 1)) * 2
```
