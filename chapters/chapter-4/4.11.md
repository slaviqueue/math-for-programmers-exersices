# Exercise 4.11

Suppose T is a vector transformation and T(0) != 0, where 0 rep- resents the
vector with all coordinates equal to zero. Why is T not linear according to the
definition?

## Answer:

Linear transformation should preserve scaling and vector sum.

```
scale(2, T(0)) should be equal to T(scale(2, 0))
```

Since T(0) is not equal, the constraint above will not be satisfied.
