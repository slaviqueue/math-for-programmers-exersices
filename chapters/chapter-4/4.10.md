# Exercise 4.10

Considering S again, the vector transformation that squares all coordinates,
show algebraically that S(sv) = sS(v) does not hold for all choices of scalars s
and 2D vectors v.


## Answer:

```
Let v = (x, y, z)
S(s * (x, y, z)) = s * S(x, y, z)
S(sx, sy, sz) = s * (S(x), S(y), S(z))
(S(sx), S(sy), S(sz)) != (s*S(x), s*s(y), s*S(z))

Left side of the equation is not equal to the right side,
because (a*b)**2 != a*(b**2)
```
